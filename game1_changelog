top, bottom, left and right walls.

changes were done in Maze Constructor.

##########
Oct 28 - 6:00 PM Change by Elena Wang

Wrote the draw method for Maze class. It calls the box draw method to draw the boxes.

##########
Oct 28 - 8:00 PM Change by Elena Wang

Wrote code for Game1Thread.java. Wrote the run method, which updates and draws the maze when new
attribute isRunning is true. Also added a setter to change isRunning. Added the required draw and
updates methods to MazeView but still need to be implemented.

##########
Oct 28 - 8:30 PM Change by Elena Wang

Wrote code for MazeView.java. Wrote code for surfaceCreated, which just sets isRunning to true in
Game1Thread and starts the thread. Wrote code for surfaceDetroyed, which destroys surface. Also
added screen width and screen height for finding the maze width and height.

##########
Oct 28 - 9:00 PM Change by Naslin Rahman

Wrote Box.draw method in Maze.java which draws a 'box' in a maze and its top,bottom,left and
right walls. It draws each corresponding wall if it is set to True and False otherwise. Created
a new Paint attribute called wallPaint in class Maze.

##########
Oct 28 - 9:30PM Change by Elena Wang

Edited MazeView.java. Added maze attribute to MazeView, which is what draws MazeView.
This maze is created in surfaceCreated() and also used in the draw method to draw.

##########
Oct 28 - 10:40 PM Change  by Elena Wang

Fixed bug in Maze constructor, which didn't allow the application to run. Hardcoded array
statements were in for loop of constructor, creating errors. This was moved out of the for loop
which fixed the bug. Maze now displays on screen.

##########
Oct 28 - 1:00 AM Change by Elena Wang

Fixed bug in Box.draw(), was missing * size, was not drawing properly. Also added margin to
center the maze, calculated by 10% of the maze width. This is added to x and y coordinates in
Maze.java.

##########
Oct 29 - 1:00 PM Change by Elena Wang

Added drawInfo method to MazeView and MazeView.draw(), which draws the instructions for the
maze game onto the canvas.

##########
Oct 29 - 1:30PM Change by Naslin Rahman
Created new class called MazeRunner and its relevant methods including method draw, move
and its appropriate getters.

##########
Oct 29 - 3:30PM Change by Naslin Rahman

maze attribute in MazeView static.

##########
Oct 29 - 6:49 PM Change by Elena Wang

Wrote javadoc for some methods in Maze.java. Cleaned up Box.draw() by making variables for
x and y values that correspond to screen size.

##########
Oct 29 - 7:12 PM Change by Naslin Rahman

Fixed MazeRunner.draw method so it draws a smaller object to represent the player in
a box. Also added Target class and implemented its relevant methods including draw which
draws a yellow square at index [4][4].

##########
Oct 29 - 8:09 PM Change by Elena Wang

Deleted draw and constructor methods in MazeView for target and mazeRunner and instead added those
methods to Maze contructor and Maze.draw(). This is so MazeView only calls maze.draw(), and Maze
draws all objects. Also deleted target and mazeRunner attributes from MazeView.

##########
Oct 29 - 9:10 PM Change by Elena Wang

Added move() method to MazeRunner. It takes in the direction and moves the mazeRunner coordinates
left, right, up or down accordingly. Also added update() method to Maze.java. This method takes in
the direction that the player needs to move and checks if there is a wall in that direction.
If there isn't, then Maze.Runner.move(direction) is called.

##########
Oct 29 - 9:30 PM Change by Elena Wang

Wrote the update() method for MazeView.java. It calls maze.update(direction). Also overrode
onTouchEvent for MazeView.java. This takes in the user's finger input and checks if user is
dragging to the left, right, top or bottom of the mazeRunner and updates MazeView accordingly.
MazeView is no longer updated in Game1Thread but in the onTouchEvent in MazeView.java

##########
Oct 30 - 4:30 PM Change by Elena Wang

Created checkGameEnd() method in Maze, which checks if player has reached target. Edited MazeView
to draw the game end screen when player reaches target. As soon as user reaches target, GameEnd
screen will show up.

Created countdownTimer attribute in Game1Activity and a textview time onto the activty

##########
Oct 30 - 7:00 PM Change by Naslin Rahman

Moved countdownTimer to MazeView and initialized it in the MazeView constructor
and wrote its onTick and onFinish methods. Also updated MazeView.draw method to
draw text for the timer until it hits 0 (staring with 20).

##########
Oct 30 - 11:35 PM Change by Elena Wang

Added MazeView.checkGameEnd() to reduce coupling.

##########
Oct 30 - 11:35 PM Change by Yi Chen Zhao

Added new class GameOverActivity that appears after the game ends, by introducing a parallel thread
that runs while the game is running, and constantly checks if the player has finished the game.

##########
Oct 31 - 12:00 AM Change by Yi Chen Zhao

Added functionality within the parallel thread to check for the status of the player finishing the
game. Modified GameOverActivity's UI design to match Game3's (feel free to change).

##########
Oct 31 - 12:00 AM Change by Naslin Rahman

Got rid of drawing the game end screen in MazeView.java.

##########
Oct 31 - 2:43 AM Change by Naslin Rahman

score is displayed when timer hits 0 and when player reaches the end of the level.

##########
Oct 31 - 3:44 PM Change by Elena Wang

Added getscore() method for both maze and mazeview classes.

##########
Oct 31 - 5:05 PM Change by Elena Wang

Used intent.puExtra to pass the score onto the game transition screen. Now the activity will
show the score of the maze.

##########
Oct 31 - 5:48 PM Change by Elena Wang

Added a package game 1 to put game 1 files in.

##########
Oct 31 - 9:13 PM Change by Yi Chen Zhao

Fixed the bug that showed the GameOver screen when attempting to replay the game. Added a
setGameEnd() method to mazeRunner that will reset its position, so that the game end status is set
to false immediately after.
